This ended up being more of a SSH brute-forcer but I guess that's okay....
Pass into the command line the target IP address, a username list seperated by new lines, and a password list seperated by new lines.
The program will output the working credentials for that host.
Example: IP -U userlist.txt -P passlist.txt
